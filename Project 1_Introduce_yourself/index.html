          Hi, my name is Michelle! This is my first year attending McHenry
          County College. I am pursuing my A.A.S in Graphic Design. These are
          some of my interest/hobbies and just a peek into my life.
        </p>
        <p id="aboutme">
          I'm a mom to a 2 year old who is very social and makes my introverted
          self more extroverted. I started attending college because I wanted to
          gain knowledge and pursue a career that I would enjoy working in, as
          well as being able to give my son a better life. When I'm able to have
          some time to myself I often find myself reading or making art. Some of 
          my favorite genres are:
          <ul>
            <li>Fantasy</li>
            <li>Psychological Thriller</li>
            <li>Romance</li>
            <li>Utopian/Dystopian</li>
          </ul>
