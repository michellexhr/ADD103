          When I say I create art, I do but it's nothing crazy. Here's a couple
          of doodles I've done that I consider good and don't feel too
          embarrassed show you guys. Often times I don't take pictures of my
          doodles because I end up throwing away the piece of paper I doodled
          on, but on the rare occasion I snap a picture to keep it and see my
          progress.

          I have never really shown my paintings to anyone but the 3 people
          closest to me, so this is a very out of my comfort zone. Ever since I
          had my son I haven't touched a paintbrush in probably almost 3 years.
          I feel like I definitely had creators block because I could not get
          any ideas of what to create for the longest time until recently(still
          haven't painted anything). My favorite medium to use for my paintings
          is acrylics. I have manily taught myself the little bit that I know
          about painting/drawing by watching videos and it's one of the reasons
          I decided to start college; to be able to develop my skills even more.

          Like I mentioned previously, my art is self taught from watching
          videos. Sometimes I get an idea for a painting and then when I make
          the sketch I get intimidated by the amount of details or how I will
          achieve the blending effect for a specific object withing the drawing.
          I have a few of unfinished projects which I want to get back to and
          finish once I feel confident enough go in with ink/paint.
