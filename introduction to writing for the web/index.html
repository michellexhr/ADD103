    <h1>Lash Out! A Fun Guide to Eyelash Extensions</h1>

    <h2>What Are Eyelash Extensions?</h2>
    <p>
      Eyelash extensions are tiny fake lashes that are glued onto your natural
      lashes. A lash expert applies them one by one to give your lashes a
      longer, fuller look — no mascara needed!
    </p>

    <p>
      You can choose a <strong>simple</strong>, everyday look or go for
      something more <strong>dramatic</strong> or <strong>elegant</strong> for
      special events. Here are your style options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple or dramatic styles</li>
      <li>Different lengths and thicknesses</li>
      <li>Materials like silk, mink, or synthetic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Long Do They Last?</h2>
    <p>
      Eyelash extensions last about <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong>. They fall out
      naturally as your real lashes shed. To keep the look fresh and flawless,
      many people get a <strong>“fill” every 2–3 weeks</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Are They Safe?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes — when done by a <strong>trained and licensed professional</strong>.
      But there are some risks to be aware of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allergic reactions to the glue</li>
      <li>Damage to natural lashes if the extensions are too heavy</li>
      <li>Infections if tools aren’t clean</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Take Care of Your Lashes</h2>
    <p>
      To keep your extensions looking fabulous — whether you chose a simple or
      elegant style — follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don’t rub your eyes</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Avoid oil-based makeup and removers</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Keep them dry for the first 24 hours</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Gently brush them daily</strong> with a clean spoolie</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Should You Try Them?</h2>
    <p>
      Eyelash extensions are a fun way to feel extra glam. Whether you're going
      for a simple everyday look, a dramatic evening style, or something soft
      and elegant for a big event — there's a lash style for everyone!
    </p>
