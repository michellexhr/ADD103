    <p>
      I will be reviewing my most recent read, which is
      <strong> Zodiac Academy</strong>. This series consists of 7 books as of
      now with the 8th book coming soon, but today I will only be reviewing the
      first book in the series. This series is focused on the Vega twins while
      also giving us other's points of view.

    <h2>The Vega Twins</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>
      Darcy and Tory Vega are the main female characters of this series and
      they're twins. Their life was pretty crazy growing up and when they turned
      18 their life took an unexpected turn for the worst/best. They were the
      rightful heirs to the throne in Solaria and even though they only wanted a
      better life for themselves, they now needed to learn how to wield their
      powers as well as endure the living hell the celestial heirs were going to
      unleash upon them.

    <h3>Principal Nova</h3>
    <p>
      The twins get told by Principal Nova that their birth names are Roxania
      and Gwendalina and Tory was not going to accept going by any name other
      than Tory.

      <q
        >Tory had been my name throughout everything that had shaped me into the
        person I was today and I had no interest in shedding that persona now or
        in the future.</q
