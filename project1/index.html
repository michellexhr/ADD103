    <h3>Fiction, Thrillers, Mysteries</h3>
    <p>
      I love reading during my free time. I like reading fiction, thrillers, and
      mysteries. I enjoy it because its a nice escape from reality into some
      amazing worlds with incredible stories to be told.

    <h3>Road trips during Fall</h3>
    <p>
      My favorite season of all time is definitely Fall. I love going on road
      trips and seeing the beautiful scenery, especially in Michigan. Although I
      haven't been to a corn maze, I am very excited to be able to take my son
      this year and be able to experience it for the first time with him.

    <h3>Why I am taking this class</h3>
    <p>
      This year I decided it was finally time to start college. At the beginning
      I wasn't really sure what career I wanted to pursue. After doing a bit of
      research I found a career that caught my attention and it was Graphic
      Design. Fundamental Web Development was one of my core classes and
      honestly I was a bit intimidated by it at first but I am confident that I
      will finish the semester understanding a bit of the coding world.
