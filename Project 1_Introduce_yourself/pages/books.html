          I started reading these books in middle school but I never got the
          chance to finish them until about 1-2 years ago. This series takes
          place an a Dystopian World. These young adults get matched to their
          life long partner at 17 years old. When Cassia goes home after getting
          matched to her childhood best friend, the image of another childhood
          friend flashes on the screen. After this unlikely glitch Cassia starts
          questioning if the Society is everything it seems to be.

          Honestly I think this is my favorite series I have read so far. I have
          finished reading the first 3 books and about to finish the fourth one.
          I usually like to read physical copies but I got a kindle for my
          birthday and have been putting good use to it. This series follows
          Darcy and Tory Vega as they discover they are lost fae princesses and
          learn how to harness their powers at Zodiac Academy, all while trying
          to defend the throne from the four heirs who want to claim it.

          This is my favorite standalone Psychological Thriller book! This book
          is about a Psychotherapist whose name is Theo Faber. He becomes
          <strong>obsessed</strong> with treating a famous artist whose name is,
          Alicia Berenson, who went mute after she murdered her husband. The
          story follows Dr. Faber's investigation to Alicia's silence, which
          uncovers dark secrets from both of their lives.
